# OpenDLP

OpenDLP is the Open Democratic Lottery Platform.

## About

**Purpose:** A web application to support finding representative samples of people to participate in Citizens' Assemblies through a two stage Democratic Lottery.

### What is a Two Stage Democratic Lottery?

A two-stage democratic lottery developers

- stage 1 - location selection. For example, choosing addresses to send invitations to.
- stage 2 - stratified selection.

Sortition creates representative groups by randomly selecting people while respecting demographic quotas. For example, if your population is 52% women and 48% men, sortition ensures your panel maintains similar proportions rather than risking an all-male or all-female selection through pure chance.

### Key Features

- Specifying the Assembly.
- Support multiple methods of location selection.
- Creating and hosting a RSVP page for invitees to sign up on.
- Doing the second stage of the democratic lottery over the set of invitees who signed up.
- Managing the confirmation process.
